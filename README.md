# Niyantri Care - Dog Care Website

This project includes four HTML pages for a playful, friendly dog care site: Home (index.html), About (about.html), Services (services.html), and Contact Us (contact.html). Tailwind CSS is used directly in the HTML via CDN. Image placeholders use the required format: src='https://pixabay.com/get/gac01db127adb90b3c4cc7078ad36ec37a72a926346d9c3c9f078d66baf3f38ca807385d6b3b2b0018291f13ee6d30b20656c4c51ebedf6cbfc5db7a649691e64_640.jpg'. All interactive elements include Tailwind transitions. The location and copyright year use provided values.

Usage:
- Open the four HTML files in a browser to view the site.
- Update text and image placeholders as needed.

Notes:
- The hero on Home is full-viewport height with a center-aligned content block.
- A responsive navigation with a hamburger menu is included.
- The footer contains three columns and a newsletter signup.
- All pages fade in on load.
